Theres a cycle of blizzard activity, in our input its 600 cycles, in the example its 12.
Depth first search works on the example but is a bad fit for the real input.
What now?

Breadth first search? With a cyclic changing environment.
Need something to label nodes as explored?

For all 600 cycles, determine where player can come (start of cycle) and go (end of cycle).
Find the shortest path from entry to exit with this info.
(first cycle is tricky because moving from entry to maze can wait?)
